## Preparations

### Use OAuth (recomended)

When Deltachat asks you to use Oauth, accept and login in the google login that pops up.


### Without 2FA

Enable "less-secure-apps" to allow non google programms to connect to your email account. (It is recomended to use Outh instead)

### With 2FA

Create an "App Specific Passwort" for DeltaChat.
