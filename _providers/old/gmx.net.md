## Comments
some free accounts seem to support 20 folders only.

if you have already 20 or more folders,
DeltaChat cannot create the DeltaChat folder and move messages there.

in this case, please clean up 
(note, that also folders in the trash are counted to the "20 folder maximum")
and create the DeltaChat folder 
in the gmx-webinterface manually.

## Preparations
activate access for external mail client at gmx side
